  <h1>Design Challenge 1</h1>
 
  <h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
  <p><a href="http://www.porsche.com" target="_blank">Porsche</a> and <a href="http://www.acmemade.com">Acme Made</a></p>

  <h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size, or balance?</h2>
  <p>Both sites make an effective use of space. The Porsche and Acmemade sites appropriately size objects on their pages which contribute to a good sense of balance overall.</p>

  <h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
  <p>Both designs are very clean, modern, appealing, and responsive designed. The overall setup of the <em>Porsche</em> site is more like a glossy ad. It's very sleek and minimal. The focal point remains the most prominent feature on each page of the Porsche site. The <em>Acme Made</em> site isn't as sleek, but it does employ attractive photography throughout the site.</p>

  <h2>Thumbnail Sketch</h2>
  <img src="wireframe_image.png" alt="Wireframe Image">
  <p>The wireframe provides a schematic overview of planned elements on the site. The focal point will be the large image that dominates the page. Smaller images are placed underneath the main image. Navigation will be light and nested, if necessary. There is an adequate amount of positive and negative space on the site that produces overall good balance.</p>
